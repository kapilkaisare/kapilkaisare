### Hello, World!

I engineer novel user experiences for high cognition workflows.

A frontend focused engineer with 15+ years of experience, I specialize in building enterprise and consumer grade web applications that reduce human error, flatten learning curves and improve user productivity. I own the production of a user experience from low fidelity wireframes to a finished product and work with server engineering teams to define (and at times implement) apis. I advocate Web Components as a means to framework independence and long term agility. I currently work with Typescript, React and Elm.

Besides working on UX engineering and information architecture, I study the characteristics of long living software systems, and am researching patterns for engineering microfrontends using web components.
