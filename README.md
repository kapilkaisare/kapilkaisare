### Hello, World!

I design and build user centric enterprise class applications that reduce human error, flatten learning curves and improve user productivity.

A SAFe certified professional with over 13 years of experience, I specialize in high cognition workflows in enterprise and consumer grade web applications. I own the production of a user experience from low fidelity wireframes to a finished product and work with server engineering teams to define (and at times implement) apis. I advocate Web Components as a means to framework independence and long term agility. I currently work with Javascript, Typescript, Angular, Ionic, Go, Python and Flask.

Besides working on UX engineering and information architecture, I study the characteristics of long living software systems, and am researching techniques of incorporating formal method verification in designing human computer interaction.
